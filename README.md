## Stormworks Chatbot

This is a Node.js server script that allows a chatbot to communicate with players in the game Stormworks. The script uses HTTP to receive messages from the Stormworks server through GET requests. The received messages are then sent to OpenAI's API for processing using the GPT-3.5 language model. The model generates a response that is sent back to the Stormworks server and displayed in the in-game chat. 

The conversation history is stored in an array called `conversationLog`, which keeps track of the role of the participant (user or assistant) and the message content. The server listens on port 3000 for incoming HTTP GET requests from the Stormworks server, and if the requested URL matches `/127.0.0.1`, the response is sent back to the Stormworks server and displayed in the in-game chat. If the requested URL does not match `/127.0.0.1`, a 404 Not Found error message is sent. 

The script uses the `dotenv` package to load environmental variables from a `.env` file, including the OpenAI API access token used for authentication.
