## Stormworks Chatbot

This is just a simple HTTP server coded in Node.js that is kinda like an interface for OpenAI's API for the game Stormworks. The first commits were awful because of me being an idiot and using chatgpt to code, do i regret it? Yes. Why? Because why use a LLM and not your brain to code. Sure, its a reliable tool, but you cant use a tool for everything. You can only learn so much and knowledge doesnt come from looking at other peoples work, it comes from experience.


The script uses the `dotenv` package to load environmental variables from a `.env` file, including the OpenAI API access token used for authentication.

### Installation

1. Subscribe to the addon on the Steam Workshop
2. Install Node.js `https://nodejs.org/en/download`
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm i`
4. Create a `.env` file and add the following variable with your OpenAI API key: 

```
OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
```
Feel free to contact me on discord if you need any extra help: Foll.

### Usage

1. Start the server using `npm start`
2. In Stormworks, start a server with the addon enabled
3. Now open Stormworks chat and send a message
4. The chatbot will respond with a message generated by the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model

## Commands

The following commands can be used in-game to interact with the chatbot:

- `?pm [text]` - Sends a private message to the chatbot. Replace `[text]` with the message you want to send.
- `?cao` - Toggles Admin-only mode.
- `?cpmo` - Toggles private messages only mode.
- `?ctr [number]` - Changes the timeout retry time. Replace `[number]` with the desired retry time in seconds. 

### Dependencies

- `http` - Node.js HTTP module for creating the server
- `url` - Node.js module for parsing URL strings
- `dotenv` - loads environmental variables from a `.env` file
- `openai` - a Node.js client for OpenAI's API
